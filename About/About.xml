	<description>The primarchs, 20 genetically-engineered transhuman "sons" of the Emperor of Mankind, were intended to be immortal and superhuman leaders for the Great Crusade to reunite humanity. Bred for perfection, they excelled as generals, warriors, and statesmen, possessing charisma and martial prowess beyond ordinary humans. Each embodied a unique aspect of war.\n\nHowever, Chaos Gods intervened, spiriting the primarchs away through the Warp to different planets. Deprived of the Emperor's guidance, they developed distinct personalities shaped by their challenging homeworlds. Despite their extraordinary abilities, the primarchs' human flaws proved to be a significant obstacle to realizing the Emperor's vision for humanity's future.</description>
